Implicit	Contingency.Cause.Reason	because	I feel so fortunate that my first job was working at the Museum of Modern Art on a retrospective of painter Elizabeth Murray	I learned so much from her
Implicit	Contingency.Cause.Reason	because	I loved looking at the paintings from the 1970s	There were some motifs and elements that would come up again later in her life
Explicit	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond	If	you might not have been able to guess	you didn't know they were hers
Explicit	Expansion.Instantiation	in fact	that a few didn't quite meet her own mark for what she wanted them to be	
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	she had set it out in the trash in her studio	her neighbor had taken it
Implicit	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence	then	she had set it out in the trash in her studio	and her neighbor had taken it
Explicit	Contingency.Cause.Reason	because	her neighbor had taken it	she saw its value
Implicit	Contingency.Cause.Result	consequently	One of the works, in fact, so didn't meet her mark, she had set it out in the trash in her studio, and her neighbor had taken it because she saw its value	In that moment, my view of success and creativity changed
Implicit	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail	specifically	my view of success and creativity changed	I realized that success is a moment, but what we're always celebrating is creativity and mastery
Explicit	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier	but	I realized that success is a moment	what we're always celebrating is creativity and mastery
Explicit	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier	But	what we're always celebrating is creativity and mastery	this is the thing: What gets us to convert success into mastery
Implicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	This is a question I've long asked myself	I think it comes when we start to value the gift of a near win
Explicit	Temporal.Synchronous	when	I started to understand this	I went on one cold May day to watch a set of varsity archers
Explicit	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal	in order	you have to aim at something slightly skew from it	
Implicit	Contingency.Cause.Result	so	I wanted to see what's called archer's paradox, the idea that in order to actually hit your target, you have to aim at something slightly skew from it	I stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	stood	watched
Explicit	Temporal.Synchronous	as	I stood and watched	the coach drove up these women in this gray van
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	I stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van	they exited
Implicit	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence	then	I stood and watched as the coach drove up these women in this gray van	and they exited
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	And	One held a half-eaten ice cream cone in one hand and arrows in the left with yellow fletching	they passed me and smiled
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	they passed me	smiled
Explicit	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier	but	smiled	they sized me up as they made their way to the turf
Explicit	Temporal.Synchronous	as	they sized me up	they made their way to the turf
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	they sized me up as they made their way to the turf	spoke to each other not with words but with numbers, degrees, I thought, positions for how they might plan to hit their target
Explicit	Expansion.Substitution.Arg2-as-subst	but	spoke to each other not with words	with numbers, degrees, I thought, positions for how they might plan to hit their target
Implicit	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence	then	they passed me and smiled, but they sized me up as they made their way to the turf, and spoke to each other not with words but with numbers, degrees, I thought, positions for how they might plan to hit their target	I stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support, and watched her, and I didn't understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring
Explicit	Temporal.Synchronous	as	I stood behind one archer	her coach stood in between us
Implicit	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal	in order	her coach stood in between us	to maybe assess who might need support
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	I stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support	watched her
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	I stood behind one archer as her coach stood in between us to maybe assess who might need support, and watched her	I didn't understand how even one was going to hit the ten ring
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	And	The ten ring from the standard 75-yard distance, it looks as small as a matchstick tip held out at arm's length	this is while holding 50 pounds of draw weight on each shot
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	She first hit a seven, I remember	then a nine
Explicit	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence	then	She first hit a seven, I remember	a nine
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	a nine	then two tens
Explicit	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence	then	a nine	two tens
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	two tens	then the next arrow didn't even hit the target
Explicit	Temporal.Asynchronous.Precedence	then	two tens	the next arrow didn't even hit the target
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	And	the next arrow didn't even hit the target	I saw that gave her more tenacity
Implicit	Contingency.Cause.Result	consequently	the next arrow didn't even hit the target	And I saw that gave her more tenacity
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	I saw that gave her more tenacity	she went after it again and again
Implicit	Contingency.Cause.Result	as a result	I saw that gave her more tenacity	and she went after it again and again
Implicit	Expansion.Conjunction	finally	For three hours this went on	At the end of the practice, one of the archers was so taxed that she lied out on the ground just star-fished, her head looking up at the sky, trying to find what T.S. Eliot might call that still point of the turning world
Explicit	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal	in order	what it means to align your body posture for three hours	to hit a target
Explicit	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier	But	It's so rare in American culture, there's so little that's vocational about it anymore, to look at what doggedness looks like with this level of exactitude, what it means to align your body posture for three hours in order to hit a target, pursuing a kind of excellence in obscurity	I stayed
Explicit	Contingency.Cause.Reason	because	I stayed	I realized I was witnessing what's so rare to glimpse, that difference between success and mastery
Explicit	Comparison.Contrast	but	success is hitting that ten ring	mastery is knowing that it means nothing if you can't do it again and again
Explicit	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond	if	that it means nothing	you can't do it again and again
Explicit	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail	though	mastery is knowing that it means nothing if you can't do it again and again	Mastery is not just the same as excellence
Implicit	Comparison.Similarity	similarly	Mastery is not just the same as excellence	It's not the same as success
Implicit	Expansion.Conjunction	furthermore	It's not the same as success, which I see as an event, a moment in time, and a label that the world confers upon you	Mastery is not a commitment to a goal
Explicit	Expansion.Substitution.Arg2-as-subst	but	Mastery is not a commitment to a goal	to a constant pursuit
Implicit	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail	specifically	What gets us to do this	what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win
Implicit	Expansion.Instantiation	for example	what get us to forward thrust more is to value the near win	How many times have we designated something a classic, a masterpiece even, while its creator considers it hopelessly unfinished, riddled with difficulties and flaws, in other words, a near win

Explicit	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail	with	Elizabeth Murray surprised me	her admission about her earlier paintings
Implicit	Comparison.Similarity	similarly	Elizabeth Murray surprised me with her admission about her earlier paintings	Painter Paul Cézanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again
Explicit	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier	but	Painter Paul Cézanne so often thought his works were incomplete that he would deliberately leave them aside with the intention of picking them back up again	at the end of his life, the result was that he had only signed 10 percent of his paintings
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	"His favorite novel was ""The [Unknown] Masterpiece"" by Honoré de Balzac"	he felt the protagonist was the painter himself
Explicit	Comparison.Contrast	when	Franz Kafka saw incompletion	others would find only works to praise
AltLex	Contingency.Cause.Result	so much so	Franz Kafka saw incompletion when others would find only works to praise	that he wanted all of his diaries, manuscripts, letters and even sketches burned upon his death
Implicit	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier	however	that he wanted all of his diaries, manuscripts, letters and even sketches burned upon his death	His friend refused to honor the request
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	His friend refused to honor the request	"we now have all the works we now do by Kafka: ""America,"" ""The Trial"" and ""The Castle,"" a work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence"
AltLex	Contingency.Cause.Result	because of that	His friend refused to honor the request	"we now have all the works we now do by Kafka: ""America,"" ""The Trial"" and ""The Castle,"" a work so incomplete it even stops mid-sentence"
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	"Lord, grant that I desire more than I can accomplish,"" Michelangelo implored, as if to that Old Testament God on the Sistine Chapel"	he himself was that Adam with his finger outstretched and not quite touching that God's hand
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	with his finger outstretched	not quite touching that God's hand
AltLex	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst	not	Mastery is in the reaching	not the arriving
Implicit	Expansion.Conjunction	further	Mastery is in the reaching, not the arriving	It's in constantly wanting to close that gap between where you are and where you want to be
Implicit	Expansion.Conjunction	further	It's in constantly wanting to close that gap between where you are and where you want to be	Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft and not for the sake of crafting your career

AltLex	Expansion.Substitution.Arg1-as-subst	not	Mastery is about sacrificing for your craft	and not for the sake of crafting your career
Explicit	Comparison.Contrast	but	that his triumphs are not merely the result of a grand achievement	of the propulsion of a lineage of near wins
Explicit	Contingency.Cause.Reason	because	Part of the reason that the near win is inbuilt to mastery is	the greater our proficiency, the more clearly we might see that we don't know all that we thought we did
Explicit	Temporal.Synchronous	when	The Paris Review got it out of James Baldwin	"they asked him, ""What do you think increases with knowledge?"" and he said, ""You learn how little you know"
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	"they asked him, ""What do you think increases with knowledge"	"he said, ""You learn how little you know"
Explicit	Comparison.Contrast	but	Success motivates us	a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest
AltLex	Expansion.Instantiation	One of the most vivid examples of this comes	Success motivates us, but a near win can propel us in an ongoing quest	when we look at the difference between Olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition
Implicit	Expansion.Instantiation	for example	One of the most vivid examples of this comes when we look at the difference between Olympic silver medalists and bronze medalists after a competition	Thomas Gilovich and his team from Cornell studied this difference and found that the frustration silver medalists feel compared to bronze, who are typically a bit more happy to have just not received fourth place and not medaled at all, gives silver medalists a focus on follow-up competition

AltLex	Contingency.Cause.Reason	because	The reason the near win has a propulsion is	it changes our view of the landscape and puts our goals, which we tend to put at a distance, into more proximate vicinity to where we stand
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	it changes our view of the landscape	puts our goals, which we tend to put at a distance, into more proximate vicinity to where we stand
Explicit	Contingency.Condition.Arg2-as-cond	If	you might describe it in more general terms	I ask you to envision what a great day looks like next week

Implicit	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail	specifically	this is what a near win does	It gets us to focus on what, right now, we plan to do to address that mountain in our sights
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	It's Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who in 1984 missed taking the gold in the heptathlon by one third of a second	her husband predicted that would give her the tenacity she needed in follow-up competition

Implicit	Expansion.Instantiation	for example	it's why the deliberate incomplete is inbuilt into creation myths	In Navajo culture, some craftsmen and women would deliberately put an imperfection in textiles and ceramics
Implicit	Contingency.Purpose.Arg2-as-goal	in order	a deliberate flaw in the pattern	to give the weaver or maker a way out
