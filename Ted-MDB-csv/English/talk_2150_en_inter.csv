Implicit	Expansion.Conjunction	and	there's other ways to think about mapping cities and how they got to be made	Today, I want to show you a new kind of map
Implicit	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier	but	I want to show you a new kind of map	This is not a geographic map
Implicit	Expansion.Substitution.Arg2-as-subst	rather	This is not a geographic map	This is a map of the relationships between people in my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland
Implicit	Comparison.Contrast	in contrast	I'm here on the green side, down on the far right where the geeks are, and TEDx also is down on the far right	on the other side of the network, you tend to have primarily African-American and Latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are
Implicit	Expansion.Equivalence	in other words	it seems as though we're living in a very small town	We see the same people over and over again
Explicit	Comparison.Contrast	But	I'm here on the green side, down on the far right where the geeks are, and TEDx also is down on the far right. (Laughter) Now, on the other side of the network, you tend to have primarily African-American and Latino folks who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are, but just to give some sense, the green part of the network we call Smalltimore, for those of us that inhabit it, because it seems as though we're living in a very small town. We see the same people over and over again, but that's because we're not really exploring the full depth and breadth of the city. On the other end of the network, you have folks who are interested in things like hip-hop music and they even identify with living in the DC/Maryland/Virginia area over, say, the Baltimore city designation proper	in the middle, you see that there's something that connects the two communities together, and that's sports
Implicit	Expansion.Instantiation	for example	that's sports	We have the Baltimore Orioles, the Baltimore Ravens football team, Michael Phelps, the Olympian
Implicit	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail	specifically	You see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco	On the one hand, you do have the media, politics and news lobe that tends to exist in Baltimore and other cities, but you also have this very predominant group of geeks and techies that are sort of taking over the top half of the network, and there's even a group that's so distinct and clear that we can identify it as Twitter employees, next to the geeks, in between the gamers and the geeks, at the opposite end of the hip-hop spectrum
Explicit	Contingency.Cause+Belief.Result+Belief	So	On the one hand, you do have the media, politics and news lobe that tends to exist in Baltimore and other cities, but you also have this very predominant group of geeks and techies that are sort of taking over the top half of the network, and there's even a group that's so distinct and clear that we can identify it as Twitter employees, next to the geeks, in between the gamers and the geeks, at the opposite end of the hip-hop spectrum	you can see, though, that the tensions that we've heard about in San Francisco in terms of people being concerned about gentrification and all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth and settlement into the city are real, and you can actually see that documented here
Explicit	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier	though	On the one hand, you do have the media, politics and news lobe that tends to exist in Baltimore and other cities, but you also have this very predominant group of geeks and techies that are sort of taking over the top half of the network, and there's even a group that's so distinct and clear that we can identify it as Twitter employees, next to the geeks, in between the gamers and the geeks, at the opposite end of the hip-hop spectrum	
Implicit	Expansion.Instantiation	for example	you can actually see that documented here	You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well, the arts community, the music community
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	And	You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well, the arts community, the music community	so it leads to things like this
Explicit	Contingency.Cause.Result	so	You can see the LGBT community is not really getting along with the geek community that well, the arts community, the music community	
Implicit	Expansion.Equivalence	in other words	that everything's really kind of mixed up	It's a very heterogenous city
Implicit	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail	in fact	You still have the lobe of people involved with government, newspapers, politics, columnists	TEDxRio is down in the lower right, right next to bloggers and writers
Explicit	Comparison.Concession.Arg2-as-denier	But	You still have the lobe of people involved with government, newspapers, politics, columnists	then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	also	You still have the lobe of people involved with government, newspapers, politics, columnists	
AltLex	Expansion.Instantiation	Even		Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here
Implicit	Expansion.Conjunction	as well as	Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here	Other boy bands, country singers, gospel music, funk and rap and stand-up comedy
Implicit	Contingency.Cause+SpeechAct.Result+SpeechAct	so	there's even a whole section around drugs and jokes	How cool is that
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	And	How cool is that	
Explicit	Expansion.Conjunction	also	Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here	
Explicit	Contingency.Cause+Belief.Result+Belief	So	It's a very heterogenous city in a way that Baltimore or San Francisco is not. You still have the lobe of people involved with government, newspapers, politics, columnists. TEDxRio is down in the lower right, right next to bloggers and writers. But then you also have this tremendous diversity of people that are interested in different kinds of music. Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here. Other boy bands, country singers, gospel music, funk and rap and stand-up comedy, and there's even a whole section around drugs and jokes. How cool is that? And then the Flamengo football team is also represented here	you have that same kind of spread of sports and civics and the arts and music, but it's represented in a very different way, and I think that maybe fits with our understanding of Rio as being a very multicultural, musically diverse city
Implicit	Expansion.Level-of-detail.Arg2-as-detail	furthermore	we have all this data	It's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now, maybe even richer than any data set that we've ever had before
Explicit	Contingency.Cause+SpeechAct.Result+SpeechAct	So	we have all this data. It's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now, maybe even richer than any data set that we've ever had before	what can we do with it
AltLex	Hypophora	what	"I think the first thing that we can try to understand is that segregation is a social construct. It's something that we choose to do, and we could choose not to do it, and if you kind of think about it, what we're doing with this data is aiming a space telescope at a city and looking at it as if was a giant high school cafeteria, and seeing how everybody arranged themselves in a seating chart. Well maybe it's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit.
The other thing that we start to realize is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity. We've got people represented from all different types of races across the entire map here -- only looking at race doesn't really contribute to our development of diversity. So if we're trying to use diversity as a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems, we need to start to think about diversity in a new way.
And lastly, we have the ability to create interventions to start to reshape our cities in a new way, and I believe that if we have that capability, we may even bear some responsibility to do so"	what can we do with it

AltLex	Hypophora	what	I think some might say that it is a geographical area or a collection of streets and buildings, but I believe that a city is the sum of the relationships of the people that live there	what is a city
